    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ceviche, a traditional Peruvian dish, is made up of citrus-cured seafood, mixed with veggies,
        and often eaten with tostadas. Ceviche has evolved over the years as it spread through latin-
        america. There are various variations with fish, shrimp, or even clams, but this recipe uses
        fish as the main ingredient.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh wild ocean fish (red snapper, tilapia, Corvina, sea bass, mahi-mahi, halibut, dorado, or Shrimp)</li>
        <li>Lime juice</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Jalapeno</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: Avocado and Radishes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the onions and place in a bowl. Add the salt and lime juice and let these marinate while you continue- this will help remove the bitterness from the onion.</li>
        <li>Cut the fish into 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch cubes and toss them with the marinating onions.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ingredients- cucumber, tomatoes and cilantro and give a good toss. If adding avocado, wait until serving to add it.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for 45-60 minutes. The longer you let the fish cure in the marinade, the more “cooked” through  the ceviche will become. I find 45 minutes is perfect.</li>
    </ol>
